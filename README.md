# PolygonAdjacencyDetermination
Determines the primary and secondary adjacency for a polygon feature layer.
This project is under development. I'm not totally sure where it is going. It is a bit of a coding exercise and also explores the idea defined below for cartographic visualization potential and also other analytical signficance.
Each polygon in a feature class can have 0 to many surrounding features that share a line segment with it. Those directly adjacent polygons, to any polygon of focus, are the first level of adjacency. Within the primary adjacent polygons set, each polygon may have 0 to many adjacent polygons from within the primary adjacent polygons set. Those in the primary adjacent polygons that are adjacent to other polygons in the same primary set compose the secondary adjacent polygons. Each polygon in the primary set is examined for secondary adjacency and the maximum value for all primary adjacent polygons becomes the secondary adjacency value for the original feature of focus.
